# Samples Using safeguard-ps
Sample scripts based on safeguard-ps.  These scripts are meant to give ideas about how safeguard-ps
may be used for automation or to solve problems.

## Sample Scripts

- **certificate-user-demo.ps1**

  This script demonstrates how to configure certificates in Safeguard so that you can authenticate
  to the API using a certificate user.  It uses data from the `data/CERTS` directory.  These
  certificates were generated by MakeCert.exe and probably aren't example, but they work. After
  create an certificate user and authenticating as that user, the sample cleans everything up. You
  will need to use the single character 'a' password when prompted to run this script.

- **new-test-entitlement.ps1**

  This script creates an approver group, requester group, and an entitlement with the given name.
  The entitlement will have a Password, an SSH, and an RDP access policy in it.  The Password
  access policy will be auto-approved.  You just need to fill out the scopes and group memberships.

- **fix-service-account-ssh-keys.ps1**

  A sample script posted to correct specific problem that occurred in the Safeguard 2.2 upgrade.
  The API was used to automate the fix for the bug for our customers.
